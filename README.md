NodeJS-Chat
===========

A simple chat application I made with Node.js and Socket.io.

## Why?

This started out with Socket.io's [basic chat application tutorial](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/).

I made this mainly to just try out and learn how to use Node.js and Socket.io, but anyone is welcome to use this and improve it. If you make any improvements remember to send a pull request to share them.

## Setup

Obviously, you'll need Node.js to use this. See [this tutorial](http://nodeguide.com/beginner.html) to learn how to install it.

Follow these steps to setup and run this chat application on your computer:

1. Clone this repository and then open the directory.
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/NathanCJohnson/NodeJS-Chat.git
    $ cd NodeJS-Chat
    ```

2. Use Node Package Manager to install the dependencies.
   ```
   $ npm install
   ```

3. Run the chat application server.
   ```
   $ node chat.js
   ```
   
If everything worked out properly, you should be able to access the chat application at `http://localhost:3000/`!
